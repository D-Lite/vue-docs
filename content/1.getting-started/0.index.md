# Chakra UI Vue

Welcome to the documentation of Chakra UI Vue. Here you can find more about Chakra UI Vue, what it is, how it can help you build applications, explore the components and theme, etc.

## What is Chakra UI Vue?

Chakra UI Vue is a design system implementation that allows you to build applications and design systems with <b>speed</b>. Chakra UI Vue comes with a list of `components`, like a button, accordion component, ... All the components are build with accessibility in mind and will ship with the needed `ARIA-labels` and `keyboard interactions` out of the box.

Chakra UI Vue also comes with a default `theme`, with colors, sizes, component styles, to get you started. But allows for a fully customization to make your application look exactly as you want it, thanks to the `extensive` theming API.

Chakra UI Vue is build for [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) and is part of the `Chakra-verse` ecosystem, along with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/).
